<td class="adtext">Effective Saturday, June 25 Flower Mound residents will be re-routed from the Lewisville Landfill to Camelot Landfill due to new restrictions at Lewisville Landfill. Camelot Landfill, 580 Huffines Boulevard, can be accessed by traveling east on FM 1171 through Lewisville, turn left onto Hwy. 121, go two miles, and turn right onto Huffines Boulevard. Residents should experience a shorter wait time, due to the absence of trucks and trailers hauling construction debris at the new site. <br /><br /></td>

<tr>
<td class="adtext">Camelot Landfill is open to Flower Mound residents free of charge on Saturdays from 7:00 am to 2:00 pm. A water bill and driver's license is required for proof of residency. The site will accept waste items generated from construction, renovation or demolition, garage sale items like appliances, furniture, mattresses, and yard waste including brush, leaves, and fencing. Non-compactable items such as dirt, brick, and concrete are also accepted, for a fee. <br /><br /></td>
