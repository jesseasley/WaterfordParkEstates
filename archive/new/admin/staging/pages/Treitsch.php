						No application for development has been submitted by the church.  However, the 
						church has met with staff to discuss the development of a family life center on 
						their property fronting Dixon Lane.  The plan that was shown to us included a 
						two-story 32,000 square foot building east of the memorial plaza, and two soccer 
						fields along Dixon Lane.<br><br>
						Once an official application is submitted it can be tracked by our on-line case 
						log (link below).  The actual plans will not be available on-line; however, anyone 
						interested has the ability to review the plans at our office (address below).  
						We ask that anyone interested schedule a meeting to ensure someone is available 
						to answer questions.  <br><br>

						Church issues raised at the annual meeting<br><br>
						There was a complaint with how the church had changed the 
						drainage with their new childrens playground area behind the church<br>
						<span class="commentsresponsetext">I inspected the area this morning, and am currently 
						looking at various methods to help with the drainage issues. The fence currently does 
						not go all the way to the ground, but does extend below the jasmine and may cause some 
						blockage. We may clear the jasmine in that area to see if that will help solve the 
						problems. Also, the drainage area around the large drain is fairly clear as far as 
						drainage is concerned, but there is trash and other debris in and around that area, 
						and we will work to clean that area. ---Jim Johnson</span><br><br>

						Another complaint about how the new fence was attached directly to a fence without the homeowner 
						being notified.<br>
						<span class="commentsresponsetext">I was unaware that the metal fence had been attached to the 
						neighbor&#700;s existing fence post, and will have that attachment removed if requested. 
						If the neighbor agrees to allow the connection to stay in place, we will work with them 
						in the event that something happens or the fence post involved needs to be moved or 
						relocated in the future. Please let me know the neighbor&#700;s wishes, and I will 
						comply as best as possible. ---Jim Johnson</span><br><br>

						Concern was voiced about the "mess" of assorted things growing behind the back parking lot<br>
						<span class="commentsresponsetext">The dumpster issue is being addressed, and the long 
						range plan is to install a concrete pad and some type of fencing around this area. We 
						are currently in the process of reviewing the possibilities of adding a Family Life 
						Center building on the vacant property, and want to make sure that we have a central 
						location for all needed dumpsters that will be more appealing to the church congregation 
						and surrounding neighbors. This will be taken care of, but it may be a few months before 
						the final determination is made as to where this area will be located.<br><br>						
						I have rearranged and cleared a great deal of the trash 
						and lumber from around our storage buildings located at the rear of the church, and hope 
						this area is no longer an eye sore for your members. <br><br>
						Please, if you or any of your members have any issues or concerns; do not hesitate in 
						contacting me. Thank you for your cooperation and suggestions. <br><br>
						I look forward to a mutually beneficial 
						relationship for many years to come.<br>
