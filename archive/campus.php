						The concerns raised in your letter will be forwarded to the Planning and Zoning Commission 
						and Town Council as part of the public record related to this request.  Further, this 
						item is scheduled to be heard by the Planning and Zoning Commission at their February 9, 2009, 
						meeting where you will have an opportunity to directly express your concerns to 
						the Commission.  Notwithstanding your concerns being forwarded to the Planning and Zoning 
						Commission and Town Council, let me comment on the three specific questions you raised in your letter:
						<ul>
							<li>
								The emergency vehicle entrance at the end of Russwood Drive will be limited to 
								emergency vehicles, and will be appropriately signed.  The LISD plans show that the 
								gate will be a single-pole design that will not preclude pedestrian access.  We have 
								asked LISD to respond to your concerns about the design and pedestrian access.    
							</li>
							<li>
								The Town could study and possibly designate no parking areas, which would be 
								accomplished with the placement of appropriate signage.  However, the enforcement 
								of the no parking area could not discriminate between adjacent resident vehicles or other vehicles.     
							</li>
							<li>
								The request for the waiver to the compatibility setback requirement has been withdrawn 
								for this specific application.  Staff did not believe that this waiver could be processed 
								as it is for the school building itself, which is not being approved with this phase.  
								However, LISD is requesting waivers to the compatibility buffer requirements to allow 
								the existing vegetation to remain and to allow fencing other than chain link.  
							</li>
						</ul>

						I am writing you this email to inform you about a Site Plan (SP) application with
						a partial waiver to Section 82-302 Compatibility buffer of the Code of Ordinances 
						that has been received by the Town.  As a courtesy, the Town notifies the HOA of 
						homeowners who abut the subject property, and our records indicate that you are 
						the current management company of the Waterford Park Estates HOA.  The application 
						is for a SP (SP 49-08 – Marcus Ninth Grade Center) to develop athletic fields and 
						accessory buildings with a partial waiver to Section 82-302 Compatibility buffer 
						of the Code of Ordinances. The property is located at 2800 Dixon Lane. 
						<br><br>
						As a courtesy, 
						I have attached a <a href="images/pz_pon.pdf" target=_blank>PDF copy of the notification</a> 
						that has been sent to each property 
						that abuts the subject property to be developed as the Marcus Ninth Grade Center. 
						<br><br>
						Please let me, or the case manager identified on the notice know if you have any 
						questions.

						They submitted their application this past Monday and it is currently under review 
						by staff.  They are planning to develop the site in two phases.  The first phase 
						will include a baseball field and a practice football/track field.  The second phase 
						will include the school building.  We will finish our initial review on January 8th.  
						In the meantime, you may schedule a meeting with us to look at the submitted plans.
