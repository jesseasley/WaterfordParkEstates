The results of the vote to annex the new development on the North side of Waterford Park into the existing HOA are as follows:
<br><br>
25 in Favor<br>
71 Against
<br><br>

In order to pass, 89 homeowners must have voted in favor, therefore, the annexation will NOT move forward.  Thank you to all the homeowners who took the time to vote on this issue.
