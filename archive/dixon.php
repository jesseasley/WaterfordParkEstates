						The Town Council meeting will be January 5th.  It is the last item on the agenda.  On 
						Dixon Lane itself I can tell you that the Dixon Lane design is waiting on the outcome of 
						the Master Transportation Plan changes.  As soon as the Master Transportation Plan is 
						final, then the design for the section west of Windridge will be awarded.  It has been 
						added to our Construction Page update on the Town’s website, 
						<a href="http://www.flower-mound.com/construct/construct_info.php" target=_blank>http://www.flower-mound.com/construct/construct_info.php</a>.

						Dixon Lane itself between Windridge and FM 2499 was recommended to Town Council to change 
						classification from the Greenway Urban Arterial section to an Urban Minor Arterial section 
						(like the rest of Dixon).  The urban collector that was recommended to go between FM 407 
						and Dixon was recommended to NOT be included in this update to the Master Transportation Plan.  
						Both will continue to go forward to the January 5th Town Council meeting.<br>
