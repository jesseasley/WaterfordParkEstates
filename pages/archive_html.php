			Thank you to all the homeowners who attended the annual HOA meeting last night.  I hope everyone found information and discussions useful. 
<br><br>
 

The winner of the attendance raffle drawing was Mark & Karon Koebel (6012 Windridge Lane).
<br><br>
The winner of the Proxy raffle drawing was Gary & Nancy Smith (6105 Crestside Drive).
<br><br>
 

Please be sure to send in your proxy next year for a chance to win a free year of HOA dues.
